## Overview

### The challenge

The key challenge of this application was to incorporate a payment gateway & Single Sign On (SSO) allowing Dog Owners to book a dog walker and pay them on completion. Think Uber but for Dog Owners.

## The process

-   Establish the idea.
-   whiteboard / develop UI flows.
-   create database table structure (normalised).
-   identify key technologies (i.e. Axios, Node.js, Cloudinary, Stripe) that will for part of the solution.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   React (for Frontend)
-   JavaScript / Node.js (for WAF)
-   Database (Postgres for storing data)
-   Axios / APIs (for GETing and POSTing data)
-   Lottie (for animated pics)
-   Custom functions
-   Yup & Formik (for data validation)
-   Bcrypt (for encryption)
-   ReCharts (for charting)
-   JWT (for website cookies)
-   Cloudinary (for image storage)
-   Stripe (for payments)

### What was learnt

-   To be documented

<!-- 1. Really enjoyed defining my own mathematical functions to calculate moving averages and RSI. The function below demonstrates the requirement to push a rolling 14 day average into an array for subsequent use.

```js
function calculateFirst14DayAverage(movingAverageDays, theDataArray) {
    var tempArray = [];
    var runningTotal = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < movingAverageDays; i++) {
        runningTotal = runningTotal + theDataArray[i];
    }

    tempArray.push(runningTotal / movingAverageDays);

    return tempArray;
}
``` -->

### Continued development

-   To be documented
